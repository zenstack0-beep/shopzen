/**
 * API base URL resolution:
 *  - Production (Vercel): /api is rewritten to Railway via vercel.json rewrites.
 *    REACT_APP_API_URL is no longer needed — all /api/* calls stay on the same
 *    Vercel domain and are proxied server-side, so cookies & CORS are never an issue.
 *  - Local dev: React proxy in package.json forwards /api/* to localhost:5001.
 *
 * We always use /api as the base — Vercel handles the routing in both cases.
 *
 * TIMEOUT NOTE:
 *   Instagram publishing requires polling the container status API until the
 *   media container reaches FINISHED state, which can take 5–12 seconds.
 *   The previous 15s timeout was too close to this limit, causing the frontend
 *   to show "failed" even though the backend successfully published the post.
 *   Increased to 45s to safely cover Instagram (≤12s) and any other slow ops.
